Initiation following discussion with Erica Christensen and Katie Zarada.

### Grub box sampling: oyster meat weights
[Grub_box_oyster_size_weight_wet_dry](Grub_box_oyster_size_weight_wet_dry.csv) contains data on wet and dry weight of individual oyster meats collected using grub box technique. Each individual sample contains information on date/time collected, GPS location, vertical stratum, height of animal, and wet and dry weights. 

### Grub box sampling: oyster shell weights
[Grub_box_shell_bulk_weights](Grub_box_shell_bulk_weights.csv) contains data on volume and weight of individual oysters (including shell) collected using grub box technique. Each individual sample contains information on date/time collected, GPS location, vertical stratum, live/dead, volume, and weight.

### Grub box sampling: counts
[Grub_box_surface_oyster_counts](Grub_box_surface_oyster_counts.csv) contains data on oyster counts within .25m^2 quadrats. Each sample contains information on GPS location of quadrat, date/time sampled, oysters live/dead, and number of oysters within quadrat.
