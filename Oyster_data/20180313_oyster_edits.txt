FILE: quadrat.locations.csv

1) All Quad_type = SURFACE, Quad_area = 0.0625, Quad_Depth = NA (exception: Dec 20, 2017, Jan 17, 2018, and Jan 30 2018: LTI1)

2) Nov 6-8, 2017: Several Dist_Alng and Dist_from values do not appear and quadrats with no oysters (zeroes) are not included as replicates. Example LCO8 (new station LCO9). This problem may extend back to earlier data converted from same style. For 2018 quadrat with no oysters we included two rows for zeroes (live and dead).

3) March 2, 2018 data needs included


FILE: quadrat_combined.csv

1) Nov 6-8, 2017: Quadrats with no oysters (zeroes) are not included. Example LCO8 (new station LCO9). This problem may extend back to earlier data.  

2) March 2, 2018 data needs included

3) Treatments should all be "control" EXCEPT: LCO1,LCO2,LCO5,LCO6 from 2014 to present, where treatment="rocks".  It is important to make this change before renaming stations as per below.   


FILE: transect_combined.csv

1) 2013/14 and Jan 30, 2018 (LTI1) transect data not included

2) Jan 30, 2018 start.time=9:44am end.time=10.12

3) Treatments should all be "control" except LCO1,LCO2,LCO5,LCO4 from 2014 to present, where treatment="rocks".  It is important to make this change before renaming stations below.


FILE: transect.locations.csv

1) station LT1 should be LTI1, date format incorrect


FILE: quadrat.locations.csv, quadrat_combined.csv, transect.locations.csv, transect_combined.csv

1) Station name edits standardizing across projects/epochs:
Year	Current		New
2010-12	LCO1		LCO6
	LCO2		LCO5
	LCO3		LCO2
2013-17	LCO1		LCO5
	LCO2		LCO6
	LCO3		LCO6
	LCO4		LCO7
	LCO5		LCO7
	LCO6		LCO8
	LCO7		LCO8
	LCO8		LCO9
2018	NLC01		LCO1
	NLC02		LCO3
	NLC03		LCO4
	GCI1		LCN4
	GCI2		LCN5
	LCI1		LCI5
	LCI2		LCI6
	LCI3		LCI7
	LCI4		LCI3

2) For all quadrat data pre-2018, sample coordinates are located in transect.locations.csv and can be linked via station name.  This is probably fine if we don't want data duplicated, the alternative is adding transect location columns to quadrat location file.

3) 2015 data needs to be included 


FILE: All raw data files

1) rename to match new file name format where possible (YYYYMMDD_organism_type)
