OK the grid (quadrat) data 2013-2017 need to be matched with the quad data from the 2012 era (one folder up).  Here is the problem, the data in 2013-2017 were entered in an odd way. Note that "along" and "from" map out where the quadrat was placed on the reef surface.  Then, at that spot the oysters are measured so a values of 37.2 is the size of the oyster etc.  What you need to see is that the sizes for the oysters (and therefore the counts) correspond to the along and away point, and that for some reason there are 6 columns of values that could be entered (measuring 6 oysters) and then if there were more than 6 oysters this then repeats on the next row with the same along and away and then the additional measurements.  So basically this has to pivot (melt) on the along-away by transect, location, date.  FINALLY note there is a column created to indicate when the number of oysters that were "over".  What this means is this is the number of oysters in the quadrat that were alive and were counted OVER the number that were measured.  So if 13 oysters were measured (would need to count the number of measurements), then anotehr 40 were counted, then the total number of oysters in that quadrat would be 43.  I think this can be solved with a reshape solution and I have a draft one in this GRID folder that it least starts by converting from wide to long.
